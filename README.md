# Getting Started with Go, with Modules

This is not meant to be exhaustive document, but only a getting started for [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).

I have gone through bits and pieces of the steps I took in my [blog post](https://medium.com/@rytswd/getting-started-with-go-with-modules-e9fd6c4a0551), but the code example should give better idea of how it works.

## How to Run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rytswd/GoModuleExample

$ cd GoModuleExample

$ go run use.go

# Output:
# Hi! Some message is here for you!
```
